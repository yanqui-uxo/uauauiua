# HOW TO UAUAUIUA

if you want to install this locally run `cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/yanqui-uxo/uauauiua.git`. i'm probably not gonna add this to crates.io

write your uiua code in main.ua

make a map called `OnPress` with lowercase ASCII keyboard keys as... keys and audio as values (must be two channels, shape [n 2])

press the key to make the sound

press shift+key to repeat the sound, shift+key again to stop repeating

recordings are saved in /recordings/[name].wav

wawaweewah
