# HOW TO UAUAUIUA

if you want to install this locally clone this repo and run `cargo install --path .` in the repo directory. i'm probably not gonna add this to crates.io

write your uiua code in main.ua

make a map called `OnPress` with keyboard keys as... keys and audio as values (must be two channels, shape [n 2])

press the key to make the sound

press shift+key to repeat the sound, shift+key again to stop repeating (NOTE: only works for letter keys)

recordings are saved in /recordings/[name].wav
